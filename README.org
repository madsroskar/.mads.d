* About this repo
** What is this?
This repository keeps my personal configuration so set up my environment. Since being introduced
to emacs by a colleague[fn:1], I've really started enjoying it, and especially =org-mode= and =magit=.

This setup is most likely just super redundant/overcomplicated, but it seemed like a fun time sink for a Saturday
to mess around a bit with =org-mode=, and some [[*Utilities][simple emacs lisp functions]].

Who I am:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle (tdir ".doom.d/config.el")
(setq user-full-name "Mads Røskar"
      user-mail-address "madshvero@gmail.com")
#+end_src

** Goals
- All config/dotfiles in one place
- Work for each environment i'd use
  + macOS
  + (TBD) Windows
  + (TBD) Linux
- Organized in a way that makes sense
** Prerequisites
- git
- patience in case things break
** Usage
- =git clonei git@github.com:madsroskar/.mads.d.git=
- Execute the buffer
  =C-c C-v b=
- Tangle everything

** Utilities
*** Evaluate needed utilities
This just exists as a convenience so I can have the utilities evaluated at the same time, rather than one at a time.
At a later stage I should find a better way to go about this, but evaluating it as a file-local-variable is considered
a security risk, and I'll  not spend too much time on that right now.

#+name: startblock
#+begin_src elisp :results output silent
(save-excursion
  (org-babel-goto-named-src-block "tangle-util")
  (org-babel-execute-src-block)
  (org-babel-goto-named-src-block "tangle-base-dir")
  (org-babel-execute-src-block)
  (org-babel-goto-named-src-block "save-and-export")
  (org-babel-execute-src-block)
  )
#+end_src
**** TODO Find a way to not have to evaluate this manually, and preferably before the rest of the config is set up
- Could possibly make it into a minor mode for myself? 🤔
**** TODO Make these not expand their headings
*** Conditional tangle per OS
To be able to be selective about which OS a file should be tangled for, I have
a simple function to pass to the tangle header argument for simplicity.

Checking the system type is based on [[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/a/14034][this stackexchange answer]].
#+name: tangle-util
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no :results output silent
(defun tos (os file-name)
  "tos (tangle OS) returns the passed file-name if the current system is the passed OS, with shortened names for convenience"
  (let ((st (cond
             ((equal os "mac") 'darwin)
             ((equal os "linux") 'gnu/linux))
            ))
    (when (eq system-type st) file-name)
    ))
#+end_src

If ran on macOS, it will look like the following:
#+begin_src elisp
(tos "mac" "right/here")
#+end_src

#+begin_example
#+RESULTS:
: right/here
#+end_example
*** Prepend a common directory to tangle files to
To avoid having to change the base directory I tangle files to, I have a simple helper
function to prepend a common base directory where I want to tangle all configuration to.

That directory will (for now at least) be my source for =stow=.

> But Mads, why don't you just do this inline on code blocks?

Idk, just seemed easier, and I can change it around later if I want, don't judge I have minimal elisp experience so far
#+name: tangle-base-dir
#+begin_src elisp :results output silent
(setq base-tangle-directory "./.files/")

(defun tdir (file-name)
  "tdir (tangle directory) takes a file name, and prepends it with a common base directory"
    (concat base-tangle-directory file-name)
  )
#+end_src

The usage will be:
#+begin_src elisp
(tdir ".config/mads/.sleep-schedule")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: ./.files/.config/mads/.sleep-schedule


#+begin_example
#+RESULTS:
: ./files/.config/mads/.sleep-schedule
#+end_example

*** Automatic export on save
I don't want to do =C-c C-e m M= all the time, so this is just a convenience to have that happen automatically.



#+name: save-and-export
#+begin_src elisp :results output silent
(defun save-and-export ()
  (interactive)
  (if (eq major-mode 'org-mode)
    (org-md-export-to-markdown)))
(add-hook 'after-save-hook 'save-and-export nil t)
#+end_src

** Complete list of custom keybinds
#+begin_src elisp :noweb yes :tangle no
<<keybind-org>>

<<keybind-doom>>

#+end_src
** DOOM Emacs
*** Config
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle (tdir ".doom.d/config.el") :comments both
:END:
This is my custom configuration for doom emacs, and all the underlying code blocks will tangle to =.doom.d/config.el=.
I have disabled the literate config module in doom emacs since I will keep the literate version of it here pre tangle
anyways.
**** Theme / looks
I used to use the =doom-dracula= theme, and have the same theme set up for several other applications, but
for some novelty I switch the themes around a bit at times. For now, swapping between these two themes seems
to be more than good enough:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
;; (setq doom-theme 'doom-dracula)
(setq doom-theme 'doom-tomorrow-night)
#+END_SRC

I tried having a transparent background for my frame, but it seemed
like macOS wasn't all that much into it and turned into jet engine mode. I legit thought it was going to lift off
from my desk.
#+begin_src elisp
;;(set-frame-parameter (selected-frame) 'alpha '(95 . 95))
;;(add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha . (95 . 95)))
#+end_src

Don't need to set the title for xterm
#+begin_src elisp
(after! xterm
  (setq xterm-set-window-title nil))
#+end_src

Show the time and battery status in the modeline.
Currently commented out as it seemed like it was producing an error,
will have to check that out later
#+begin_src elisp
;; (display-time-mode 1)
;; (unless (string-match-p "^Power N/A" (battery))
;;   (display-battery-mode 1))
#+end_src

Set frame title depending on whether the file in the active buffer has been
modified since the last write or not
#+begin_src elisp :results output silent
(setq frame-title-format
      '(""
        (:eval
         (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
           (unless (string= "-" project-name)
             (format (if (buffer-modified-p)  " ◉ %s" "  ●  %s") project-name))))))
#+end_src

***** TODO Font (Shell script? elisp? whoknows)
I kind of arbitrarily decided to try out the Hack Nerd Font, and somehow can't imagine using anything else right now,
so I've set that up for myself. However, this naturally needs to be installed before use.

Steps to get this working:
1. Install the font on your system
   a. macOS (Baaaah, can't figure out how to make it only write the file, poopoooooo)
   b. Linux
2. Have doom use the Hack Nerd Font
**** Org-mode
I currently just use the default setting for the org mode directory:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq org-directory "~/org/")
#+END_SRC

I also have the agenda files in the same directory. As for right now I haven't spend the
time or effort needed to get into using the agenda views at all, so this might have to change
for all I know.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-agenda-files '("~/org"))
#+end_src

Custom org headline bullets so I'll look cool if somebody sees me in org-mode:
#+begin_src elisp
(setq
    org-superstar-headline-bullets-list '("⁖" "◉" "○" "✸" "✿")
)
#+end_src

The original mapping for shiftmetaright was a bit wonky, =M-l= works better for me
#+name: keybind-org
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :map org-mode-map
      :after org
      :n "M-l" #'org-shiftmetaright)
#+end_src
**** Keybinds
Most keybinds are set up by doom and evil-mode, but a few have been added or changed to work
better for me. See a [[*Complete list of custom keybinds][complete list of custom keybinds for an overview]]

Use command in macos as Meta, and don't pass it to the system:
#+name: keybind-doom
#+begin_src elisp
(setq mac-command-modifier 'meta)
(setq mac-pass-command-to-system nil)
#+end_src

*** init.el
This is the entry point to the DOOM configuration, which sets up modules to be used with the setup.

#+begin_src elisp :tangle (tdir ".doom.d/init.el") :results output silent
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;      documentation. There you'll find a "Module Index" link where you'll find
;;      a comprehensive list of Doom's modules and what flags they support.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;;      Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
;;      directory (for easy access to its source code).

**** TODO extract the packages and config from this file into the proper config
*** package.el 
This file should define all packages I want to have available, on top of what doom gives me.

#+begin_src elisp :tangle (tdir ".doom.d/packages.el")
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
;;; $DOOMDIR/packages.el

;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.


;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;(package! another-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;(package! this-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify

;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.

I've been converted. I can no longer use anything else than emacs. This is far too good to have as a tool for me to be able to even try something else. I don't think it's stockholm syndrome, but I guess it's tough to know for sure if it's yourself.

*** Path
I wasn't aware of the lowercase =path= array, but that makes dealing with the path environment variable so much better. Stumbled across it in a [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/18077919/2246084][StackOverflow answer]].

I currently use Alacritty as my terminal emulator, even though I very rarely need the terminal emulator anymore since I do just about everything in emacs.

Alacritty does feel pretty nice in use though, and is pretty simple to configure as it's a matter of dealing with one single yaml file - now in org-mode 😎
